The  [SLC Conversation Partners Program](https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/slc/eal/conversation/registration-form-eal-esl-students)  pairs EAL students with volunteer peers. Conversation partners then meet on a weekly basis throughout the semester.

In this blog post, SLC Peer  **Bessie W.** interviewed two of her conversation partners, Bin and Dan, to hear their unique perspectives on the program and their experiences at SFU.

**Bin**  is an Economics student who arrived in Canada three years ago from the Guangdong province of China.

**Dan**  is an Interactive Arts and Technology student from the SiChuan province of China.

**What motivated you to participate in the SLC Conversation Partners Program?**

**Dan:**  For international students, language is the first challenge, especially for first year students. There is no other way for us to know the cultural differences and having a conversational partner will help us to understand. A lot of the English we learned in high school is not applicable to what we actually say in an English-speaking country.

**Bin:** I was planning to sign up for co-op next semester and wanted someone to practice my speaking skills with because there will be lots of situations where I will need to speak my opinions, such as during interviews.

**What is your biggest takeaway from the program so far? What did you enjoy the most?**

**Dan:**  Before attending this program, I was not comfortable speaking in discussions and teamwork and I was fearful that they wouldn’t take my opinions seriously. Now, I have the courage to speak out and express myself, especially among English speakers.

**Bin:** I was provided with a great opportunity to practice and improve my English speaking skills. My peer was like a mentor to me because she was patient with me, and it was an open space where I could ask questions. We even talked about the past election that occurred!

**Where do you see yourself in five years? Staying in Canada or elsewhere?**

**Dan:**  I hope to graduate and find a job here. My goal is to make a living by myself, with no financial support from my parents. My own mindset has changed a lot after living in Canada, so I might not follow the culture back in China. For example, people doing business in China often talk indirectly when giving feedback or criticism, but I prefer people to be direct.

**Bin:**  For myself, I would ideally like to work for 2-3 years after graduation and then move back to China. Family is important to me and that is a motivational factor for me. It is where I feel the most at home, where I belong.

**What are some of the struggles of living as an EAL student at SFU/ in Canada?**

**Dan:** During my first year as a Fraser International College student, I couldn’t understand the academic language from the professors. I would question their processes because of the cultural difference.

**Bin:** Academically, listening is hard because we end up falling more behind and have to make up with extra study time in order to fully understand the material. Participation is a big deal in universities in Canada, so we must speak up in order to earn marks, but sometimes we might be judged or critiqued from our lack of English.

**What are some things that you would like non-EAL students to know?**

**Dan:** This program is not just for learning and improving the English language, but through language we can learn a lot of people’s ideologies and their thoughts, and how they engage in their ideas. We both learn from each others’ perspectives.

**Bin:**  Learning a language is a continuous process, it takes time and as much as you learn it, you also need to use it. The most important thing is that you need to find a real interest so that you can practice. Maybe that is watching a TV show or reading a book in that language.

**Thank you both for sharing your thoughts and experiences!**

-- **Bessie W.** has been an EAL Peer at the Student Learning Commons since 2015. She enjoys learning about various cultures and languages around the world. She is a Communications student with an interest in writing and social media marketing.
